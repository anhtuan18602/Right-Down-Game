<h2>Game Procedure</h2>
<br>
<div>

  <p>Your own position in the sequence — whether you are Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, and so on — is pre-determined and will be communicated to you before the game starts.</p>

  <p>Your decisions have real consequences and will directly affect your earnings (bonus payments) and those of other participants. You will be matched with real participants from Prolific who are playing the same game in different positions in the sequence.</p>

  <p><strong>Please note:</strong> not every participant plays at the same time. You will receive information about others' decisions and your final earnings a few days after completing the study.</p>

  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Your decisions will not affect the timing of your bonus payment.</p>

  <p>Before it is your turn to choose an action — <em>"right"</em> or <em>"down"</em> — you will be informed of your position in the sequence.</p>

  <p>From your position, you can observe the decisions made by earlier players. Your final earnings will be based on their decisions and your own. Likewise, your decision may influence earnings for earlier players and — if you choose <em>"down"</em> and the computer selects ≤ 90 — also for players who come after you.</p>
